In an effort to connect with Sech's USA audience as we launched his first USA tour, I created a landing page that provided users with a one stop location to purchase tickets and enroll in our community messaging platform for USA followers. 

## Goal

With Sech's first USA tour underway, we wanted to have one location which we could channel all tour related traffic to. One page allowed for us to better manage all of the user data we were generating from users who were interetested in our first USA tour. By integrating our Google Analytics tag into the page, we were able to get user data to help us better remarket and target the audience that showed interest in our tour. 

1. Which country are you from?

As soon as users enter, we display a modal that based on their answer would create a unique user experience for them. 

If they select United States, they'd be followed up with button encouraging them to enroll in our USA community list to receive exclusive access to artist releated news.
To make it more seamless for the user to enroll, by clicking the button, their default SMS Messaging application would be opened with a pre written message, so all they have to do is send.

Any user outside of the US was prompted to just sign up to our subscription list to receieve special access to artists related news. 

## FUN

I had a lot of fun with this project! I took the chance to get more familiar with creating custom CSS3 animations to offer a unique user experience compared to your average landing page. On load, I had a gif simulating the idea of a rocketship taking off to go with the tour branding, and on the landing page had the tour logo floating on a background that had a dark sky with stars type effect. 

### Animations

1. Floating
2. Fade In
3. Fade Out

## Takeaway

Every project I work on I take them as a chance to improve my abilities to use certain technologies but to also leverage technologies to offer a unique user experience. This project was one of many that I had the chance to create something fun while focusing on the goal of getting ticket sales and getting user data to analyze and better market to those users.
